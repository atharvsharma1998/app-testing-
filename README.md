# Mobile-App-testing-Automation

During my role as System Engineer at Mahindra in Research and Development Division, I was responsible for the testing and validation of smart cloud features in the development of the connected car application. Due to the constraints in the availability of physical hardware and the actual automobiles for testing, the process was often delayed, resulting in extended project timelines.

To solve this problem, I developed python scripts for  the automation of the testing and validation using Testproject SDK. This script was developed to run a suite of automated test cases that encompassed various scenarios such as erroneous inputs, simultaneous multiple inputs, and response validation.

The implementation of this automated testing framework significantly reduced the duration and effort required for testing. More importantly, it yielded comprehensive reports that facilitated the prompt identification of failures in cloud communication. This led to a marked improvement in both efficiency and reliability during the testing phase of the project.

Through this initiative, I contributed towards accelerating the development cycle and enhancing the overall quality of the connected car application.
